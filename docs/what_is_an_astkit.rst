What is an ASTKit anyway?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ASTKit is a library containing code that makes it easier to work with the Python (2.6+) standard library's ast module. As of now, ASTKit only provides a renderer that will produce Python source code from an ast.Node. In the future, we hope to provide more utilities and tools; possibly this could include additional visitors and maybe a macro system.
